# Note to Spriters

It would be convenient if you could pass along sprites to [someone?] who can then match the given files with code. Repository collaboraters is a future potential.

As of note, I'll manage the code base here for now -- you can download the code and run tests on specific items if you so desire (there might be a file pack download to ease this process).
